            I used to watch documentaries about dinosaurs when I was 6-7 and by
            seeing graphics of dinausors walking in forests, I decided to become
            a paleontologist and create Jurassic Park. <br />
            Then the second obsession of mine was neurosurgeon, I've heard
            somewhere that the hardest job in medicine was neurosurgeon. <br />
            Then the third obsession of mine came when I finished watching the
            first season of Sword Art Online. Basically in this anime, we can
            immerse ourselves in a virtual world where we can feel pain and do
            everything we do in the real world. I thought that if I go into
            neuroscience, maybe one day, I will be able to create a full
            immersive experience of the real world, where we would just lay down
            on a bed and be able to run, jump, and battle with swords.
