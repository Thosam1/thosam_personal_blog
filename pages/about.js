                I come from a Tibetan family and grew up in Lausanne/Prilly in

                I used to watch documentaries about dinosaurs when I was 6-7 and
                by seeing graphics of dinausors walking in forests, I decided to
                become a paleontologist and create Jurassic Park. <br />
                Then the second obsession of mine was neurosurgeon, I've heard
                somewhere that the hardest job in medicine was neurosurgeon.{" "}
                <br />
                Then the third obsession of mine came when I finished watching
                the first season of Sword Art Online. Basically in this anime,
                we can immerse ourselves in a virtual world where we can feel
                pain and do everything we do in the real world. I thought that
                if I go into neuroscience, maybe one day, I will be able to
                create a full immersive experience of the real world, where we
                would just lay down on a bed and be able to run, jump, and
                battle with swords.

                Now many things in life led me to think more deeply about the human nature and the meaning of life. After studying Buddhism, I realized how little I knew about myself and how ignorant I were spiritually and philosophically. Currently I am striving to become a great software engineer that can help solve world issues and make this world a better place for all living creatures. In my spiritual journey, I will put a few updates that you can find
